detailed-help=** Make sure to run configuration prior to the first Carbyne Stack CLI command execution ** \n \
\n \
This command will guide through a step by step configuration to match the VC's setup. \n \
While it is required to run the configuration at least once prior to the first command execution, it is possible to overload some settings using environment variables. \n \
The following environment variables can be used to adapt the configuration without overwriting the default config. \n \
- CS_PRIME \t Modulus N as used by the MPC backend \
- CS_R \t Auxiliary modulus R as used by the MPC backend \
- CS_R_INV \t Multiplicative inverse for the auxiliary modulus R as used by the MPC backend \n \
- CS_NO_SSL_VALIDATION \t Disable SSL certificate validation \n \
- CS_VCP_{n}_BASE_URL** \t Base URL for the provider with ID \"{n}\" \
- CS_VCP_{n}_AMPHORA_URL* \t Amphora Service URL for the provider with ID \"{n}\" \n \
- CS_VCP_{n}_CASTOR_URL* \t Castor Service URL for the provider with ID \"{n}\" \n \
- CS_VCP_{n}_EPHEMERAL_URL* \t Ephemeral Service URL for the provider with ID \"{n}\" \n \
- CS_VCP_{n}_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID * \t OAuth2 client identifier for the provider with ID \"{n}\" \n \
- CS_VCP_{n}_OAUTH2_CALLBACK_URL * \t OAuth2 callback URL for the provider with ID \"{n}\" \n \
\n \
* Please be aware, that only providers defined in the default configuration can be adapted using environment variables. It is not possible to add additional or remove existing providers. \n \
** This variable is used during the configuration process only.
